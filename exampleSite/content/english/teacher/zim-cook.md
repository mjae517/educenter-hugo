### About Me

Hello! As one of the founders of our school I am happy to welcome you! My desire to educate children utilizing Montessori teaching methods has been my personal and professional passion for more than 30 years. I spent 20 years with the NorthShore Montessori Schools as founder of their elementary Program and supervisor and teacher for 8 years. I began in 1992 as a Preschool Directress and have been an advocate and lifelong learner, teaching the unique philosophy of Maria Montessori for more than 31 years. I earned a Master of Arts degree in Teaching and Leadership from Saint Xavier University and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Commerce. I Am AMS certified for 3-6, 6-9, and 9-12 year olds. Both of my children were Montessori students beginning from early childhood through the sixth grade. As a mother I see how my children developed strong self- motivation, awareness in managing their time and schedules independently and strong problem solving skills.
